# 10/10 (will)

slight delay in summary write-up, apologies. this week's office hours were very
light on course content. the only discussion i can remember around course
material was a question about the difference between "bits of security" and
"bits of entropy". my understanding is that "bits of entropy" is a measure of
the unpredictability present in a system, whereas "bits of security" is a more
formal measure of the strength of a cryptographic primitive (there's a good
explainer [here][1], and the [wikipedia page][2] is good).

the rest of the discussion focused largely on the project and
logistics/timelines therein. to sum it up, unless you consider yourself a
strong programmer, i'd strongly recommend going the midterm route. you should
be comfortable with TCP socket programming, byte-level manipulation and
encoding, unit testing, and using 3rd party libraries in your language of
choice. the project will be much, much harder than the psets as creating a
real, working TLS client will be a substantial portion of the overall grade. we
do not yet have guidance on how the project will be graded, so it is possible
that the scaffolding portion alone will not substantiate enough of the project
grade to guarantee a passing grade on the project (which if you elect to do it,
is 50% of your term grade).
