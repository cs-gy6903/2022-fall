## Summary

- questions around how to convert between bytes and int, should add resources
  seciton on converting between bytes + int in python.
    + [DONE](https://github.com/cs-gy6903/resources/commit/567b152d233904cc8fb75cb729a20a26867b5001)
- pset4 problem 7 similar to incremented nonce in project? why why not?
    + sorta, in that they both involve counters, but pset4 deals with the
      _implementation_ of block cipher modes of operation while the projcect
      deals with the _use_ of those modes. in the project, we use AES GCM,
      which wasn't covered in pset4. GCM is an AEAD variant of counter mode.
      for the purposes of TLS 1.3, we need to only provide the _initial IV_ to
      each record encryption with the per-record nonce constructed as described
      in 5.3 of the RFC (confusingly the nonce in TLS is _also_ constructed
      using a counter, but only incremented for each new record read or
      written, not each _block_ as in pset4).
- hash quines, link to recent levine piece
    + see part 1.c. where he starts to talk about hashing
- question about project's ValueProtocol stuff in `public.py` using generic
  types. demurred on this due to lack of familiarity with much of python's
  `typing` library`.
- need to include Certificate and CertificateVerify in the client/server
  finished? yes, for our purposes you need the server Certificate and
  CertificateVerify (but not client unless doing mTLS)
- discussion around cert chain walking. what does the server send to the
  client? will contends if only 2 certs are sent, then they will be the leaf
  cert and the intermediate CA. reason being that if the client already has the
  root CA cached in its trust store, it already has the public key it needs to
  verify the intermediate CA's issuer signature.

## Suggestion

If you're doing the project, the project spec/resources includes support for
testing SNI/non-SNI nginx connections locally. First, `cd` into the project
directory and start up `docker compose`:

```
$ docker compose up
[+] Running 1/0
 â ¿ Container project-nginx-1  Created                                                                                                                                                                  0.0s

```

Then, run `make sni` to connect to nginx via SNI or non-SNI. You can inspect
the `openssl` output and/or a wireshark capture to see what's going on (here we
can see the leaf certificate, as indincated by its Issuer being the
intermediate):

```
$ make sni
echo | openssl s_client \
        -tls1_3 \
        -showcerts \
        -build_chain \
        -CAfile ./nginx/certs/root.pem \
        -servername cs-gy6903.nyu.edu \
        -verify_hostname cs-gy6903.nyu.edu \
        localhost:8443 \
        | tee sni \
        | openssl x509 -text -noout
