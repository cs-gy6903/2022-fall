# 9/26/22 (will)

i showed up late, apologies. initial topics covered were PRPs vs. PRFs. some
raw notes from the discussion (hopefully?) illustrating the difference between
a function and a permutation (not mathematically, just as a cartoon in the
python programming language).

notes:

## PRP vs. PRF
- PRP: pseudo-random _permutation_
- PRF: pseudo-random _function_
- difference between between? function vs. permutation
- function `f`, input domain: `X`, output domain: `Y`
    + ex1: `X: all integers (e.g. 1)`, `Y: all floats (e.g. 1.0)`, `f: float()`
- permutation `p`, input `X`, output domain: `X`
    + ex2: `X: all integers (e.g. 1)`, `Y: all integers (e.g. 2)`, `p: lambda
      x: x + 1` REPL demonstration of domain X, a.k.a int and domain Y a.k.a
      float (note that for PRPs, input and output domain are same)

```python
$ python3
Python 3.9.14 (main, Sep  6 2022, 23:29:09)
[Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>
>>> float(1)
1.0
>>> f = float
>>> type(f(1))
<class 'float'>

>>> p = lambda x: x + 1
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>
>>> p(1)
2
>>> type(p(1))
<class 'int'>
```

example that a PRF (i.e. a FUNCTION) has different output domain (i.e. output
can have different size from inputs), illustrated with SHA-1:

```bash
$ echo foobar | sha1sum
988881adc9fc3655077dc2d4d757d480b5ea0e11  -

$ echo foobarbaz | sha1sum
97bd38305a81f2d89b5f3aa44500ec964b87cf8a  -

$ echo foobarbazbafasdfasdfas | sha1sum
8de36a58430ee89e98045043a28841e5316a3513  -

$ head -c $((1024 * 1024)) /dev/random | sha1sum
03a36b7db0deacffa1750a298ca4f57eb43bb29d  -
```

other questions around problem 3 from #ps1, reminder to all that MODULATION
SHOULD HAPPEN INSIDE THE LOOP, not outside the loop. here's an example for how
to write a function which determines whether input bytes are even. note that we
do the modulo operation `(%)` INSIDE THE LOOP to determine the numerical
property:

```python
>>> def is_even(b: bytes) -> List[bool]:
...     out = []
...     for x in b:
...             out.append(x % 2 == 0)
...     return out
...
>>> is_even(b'abcdef')
[False, True, False, True, False, True]
```

finally, to prepare for #ps2, which will be released this wednesday after
class, you should know how to perform exponentiation in python:

```python
>>> 2 ** 3
8
>>> 16 ** .5
4.0
```

in this example, we're saying that 2^3 == 8 and that the square root of 16 is
4.
